Alarmz is a utility that shows alarms at a given date and time, with a few ways
of displaying alarms (message boxes and "toasts").

Versions 1.0 and 1.1 of Alarmz were written in Visual Basic 6. Version 2.0.0 is
a complete rewrite of the original Alarmz in C++ using Qt. Version 2 is cross-
platform, has new options (including a Language option) and fixes a few bugs.

The source code for versions 1.0 and 1.1 is not available to the public, but
could be given away upon request (contact fragag@hotmail.com). The source code
for version 2.0.0 was made available on my personal website
(http://fragag.ifrance.com/) and was later uploaded to GitHub.
